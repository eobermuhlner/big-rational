# big-rational

BigRational is a replacement for BigDecimal with arbitrary automatic accuracy.

For the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) you never need to specify a precision,
the result is always infinitely accurate.

All values are internally stored as [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).
